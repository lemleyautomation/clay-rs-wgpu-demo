# clay-rs-wgpu-demo
A demo project for the Rust wrapper of the Clay UI Library

This is basically just a smashing together of the learn-wgpu tutorial and clay intro video.

There is a lot of room for improvement in this code, it is very inconsistent in some places.

It has only been tested on Windows 11.

The Clay dependency is set up to use a local cloned version of the repository rather than crates.io, a "nightly" build, if you will.
