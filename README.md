# clay-rs-wgpu-demo
A demo project for the Rust wrapper of the Clay UI Library

This is basically just a smashing together of the learn-wgpu tutorial and clay intro video.

There is a lot of room for improvement in this code, it is very inconsistent in some places.

It has only been tested on Windows 11, but everything "cross-platform"
